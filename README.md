# FromZeroToMicroservices
This is going a series from starting with an empty code space to a microservices architected car sharing / car rental application.
What will do:

1. Start with a short description of the domain ( car sharing )
2. Build one service by another
3. Run them standalone as docker containers
4. Tie them together with "Projekt tye" or docker-compose.
5. Add an application gateway (YARP)
6. Build an Blazor UI
7. Deploy to Azure using Azure Containers Apps
   
The order is not fixes and is onyl a plan
During devolpment we will apply patterns (e.g. Mediator, CQRS, BFF, ...) and improve the code by adding well-known frameworks ( MediaTR, FluentValidations, AutoMapper, ...) and many more...
It's a playground, but with focus on a production ready system.
